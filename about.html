        <h3 class="class1">Past</h3>
        <p>My past is full of learning experiences from all over the  country. I was originally from Michigan but I moved to California as a child. I  spent a lot of my childhood playing sports and going to auditions trying to be  an actor. But, after fifth grade I moved back to Michigan to be closer to  family. During my schooling, I went a different route. I chose to go into  robotics, engineering, and automotive. So, once high school rolled around, I was  enrolled in a technical campus as well as a regular high school. I went to the  technical campus for engineering and automotive while being on the robotics  club. After high school, I was introduced to even more experiences by getting  accepted into Michigan State University.</p>

  		<h3>Present</h3>
        <p>During my time at Michigan State University (MSU), I was  introduced to the world of advertising. Doing culinary on the side, I learned  many computer programs necessary to thrive on the creative side of advertising.  My eyes were opened up to just how much work is needed to make campaigns  happen. People spend mostly everyday exposed to advertising of some sort but  those moments when you get someone to actually stop and look at your work just  can't be described. So, as of now, I&rsquo;m focused on practicing my skills. Trying  to get on that level of creativity where everything I produce will catch the consumer&rsquo;s  eyes and create a lasting memory. Through the use of the Adobe creative suite and  my ability to generate ideas on the spot, the future looks bright.</p>

  		<h3>Future</h3>
        <p>As for my future, I want to work with a company that's going  places. Not saying that I haven't worked for established and important companies, because I've  worked in the culinary industry for Michigan State as well as worked in Florida  at Walt Disney World. But, what I&rsquo;m looking for is a company that really  understands what the consumer wants and not just trying to get by. A company  that's looking for someone like me that wants to see something made that gets  the recognition it deserves. Also, a company that's fun but at the same time  likes to take risks because that's where true innovation comes from.</p>
